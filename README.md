# Sunflower Design
The Onshape platform was used to create a 3D model of a flower, as shown. Onshape is one of the leading online tools for 3D design, offering an integrated workspace for developing creative ideas and turning them into functional models. The goal of this project was to learn the basics of 3D design using tools such as sketching, extrusion, rotation, and assembly.
